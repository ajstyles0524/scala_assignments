  // JSON Notation

  // In Scala, JSON notation is used to represent data in a format
  // that is easy for humans to read and machines to parse. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
  // ....
  // JSON notation uses a key-value format, where keys are strings and
  // values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or other JSON objects.
  // ....
  // In scala, There are several libraries that can be used to work with JSON including json4s, circe, and upickle.
  // Each of these libraries provides a way to work with JSON notation in Scala, including parsing JSON strings, generating JSON strings, and working with JSON data in a type-safe manner.
  // ....
  // Additionally, the Play Framework provides its own JSON library, play.api.libs.json,
  // which provides a similar set of functionality for working with JSON notation in Scala.

  // Here's an example of creating a JSON object using the JsObject class:
  // The Json.obj method creates a new JsObject instance with the given fields. Each field is defined as a tuple of a string (representing the field name) and a value.
