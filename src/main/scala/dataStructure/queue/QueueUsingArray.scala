package dataStructure.queue

// Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which
// the operations are performed for storing data. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
// The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.
// In a stack we remove the item the most recently added;
// in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

//Queue is used when things donâ€™t have to be processed immediately,
// but have to be processed in First In Firs Out order like Breadth First Search.
// This property of Queue makes it also useful in following kind of scenarios.
//
//When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
//When data is transferred asynchronously between two processes
